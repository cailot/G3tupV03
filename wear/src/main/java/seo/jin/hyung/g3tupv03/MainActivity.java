/**
 * The main activity for the Jumping Jack application. This activity registers itself to receive
 * sensor values. Since on wearable devices a full screen activity is very short-lived, we set the
 * FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON to give user adequate time for taking actions but since we don't want to
 * keep screen on for an extended period of time, there is a SCREEN_ON_TIMEOUT_MS that is enforced
 * if no interaction is discovered.
 *
 * This activity includes a {@link android.support.v4.view.ViewPager} with two pages, one that
 * shows the current count and one that allows user to reset the counter. the current value of the
 * counter is persisted so that upon re-launch, the counter picks up from the last value. At any
 * stage, user can set this counter to 0.
